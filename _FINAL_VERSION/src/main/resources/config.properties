#     DATABASE CONFIGURATION (The "Address Book" for my Data)
#========================================================================
#    This section tells the server 'where' its data lives (the database) and how to get access to it.
#    Think of it like the address and keys to the main warehouse.

#    "db.url": This is the exact "street address" of the DB.
#      - 'jdbc:mysql://'    This says we're talking to a MySQL DB.
#      - 'localhost'        Means the DB is running on the same computer as the server.
#      - '3306'             This is the default "door number" (port) MySQL listens on. Standard.
#      - '/inventorymgmt'   This is the 'specific name' of the database (the "warehouse building") we want to use.

#db.url=jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:3306/inventorymgmt
#  better:
#db.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/inventorymgmt?serverTimezone=UTC&useSSL=false
#  best:
db.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/inventorymgmt?serverTimezone=UTC&useSSL=false&allowPublicKeyRetrieval=true

#    db.user: This is the 'username' required to get into the DB warehouse.
#        I created the "Admin" user 'inside' MySQL and give it permissions. Cap "A"
db.user=Admin

#    db.pass: This is the 'secret password' for the 'db.user'. Same random number from before, inside MySQL.
db.password=6093007

#  Funny note here:
#  key - value    (won't work)
#  key : value    (technically works, but = is clearer: My standard.)
#  key= value     (works, but the space becomes part of the value)
#  key =value     (works, but harder to read)

#------------------------------------------------------------------------
#     SSL/TLS Key Store Configuration (The Server's "ID Badge")
#------------------------------------------------------------------------
#    For the "_01_InventoryServer" connection:
#    To do business with high-security building, like a bank, the bank needs two things:
#       1. A secure vault (server.keystore) to hold its official identity papers.
#       2. A secret password to open that vault.
#    When a client application tries to connect to the server, the first thing it does is ask:
#       "Are you really the server I think you are? Prove it!"
#    With these instructions (1 & 2) at startup, the server is ready. It uses the information to:
#       1. Go to the vault (.keystore file).
#       2. Open it with the password.
#       3. Pull out its official ID (its SSL certificate).
#       4. Show this ID to the client.
#    Then the client verifies this ID, and if everything checks out, they establish a secure, encrypted connection.
#    Without those two lines, the server wouldn't know where its own ID is, and it couldn't prove its identity to anyone.

#    ssl.keystore.path: This tells the server 'where' its secure vault (the 'server.keystore' file) is located on the computer.
ssl.keystore.path=server.keystore

#    ssl.keystore.password: This is the 'password' needed to 'open' the 'server.keystore' vault. It MUST exactly match the
#       password you used when you 'created' the keystore file.
#    ssl.keystore.password="changeit"  //  Original Default. Leaving this in a production system is a huge security risk.
#    The actual string of characters we use for the password, whether it's "changeit", "password123", or a creative leet
#       code phrase, makes no difference to the program. The only thing that matters is that the two sides match.
#    We'll use leet for "I'm a connection password":
ssl.keystore.password=1m_4_c0nn3c710n_p455w0rd
#    This is all internal. We'll never see an if statement in our own code that compares the keystore password.
#    Translation: Hey Java Security System, when the time comes, the password you'll need for my keystore is '1m_4_c0nn3c710n_p455w0rd'.
#    When the _01_InventoryServer starts, it will read "1m_4_c0nn3c710n_p455w0rd" from the config file and use it to unlock the keystore.
#    Since the passwords match, it will work perfectly. As long as the password stays the same in those two places, the server
#       will start up correctly and will handle all subsequent client connections without any issues.



#========================================================================
#     CLIENT CONFIGURATION (For the Client Applications)
#========================================================================
#    These settings are used by the client when connecting to the server.

#    client.host: The address of the server (use 'localhost' for same machine,
#                 or an IP address/domain name for remote servers)
client.host=localhost

#    client.port: The port number the server is listening on (must match server.port)
client.port=8888

#    client.truststore.path: Location of the client's truststore file
#                            (contains the server's public certificate)
client.truststore.path=client.truststore

#    client.truststore.password: Password to unlock the client's truststore
#                                (must match the password used when creating the truststore)
client.truststore.password=1m_4_c0nn3c710n_p455w0rd

Welcome to My Inventory System Project

This here is a project for my Software Engineering I class. It's an inventory management system, but it's got a bit of a story. It started out as one thing and, well, it kinda evolved into this whole big client-server-database contraption.
It's got a "front end" (the client) that the user sees, built with JavaFX, and it's got a "back end" (the server) that does all the heavy lifting and talks to a MySQL database.
